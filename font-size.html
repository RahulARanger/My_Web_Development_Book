Font size is very important way to modify the text in the HTML Document.
we can use pixels or ems as the way to modify the size (we prefer pixels)
1 px = 16 em
we can use vm as the unit but this is very different from the rest units
Viewport is the browser window size. 1vw = 1% of viewport width. If the viewport is 50cm wide, 1vw is 0.5cm.</pre>
