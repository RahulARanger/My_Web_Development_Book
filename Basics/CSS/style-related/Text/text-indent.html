                Text -indent makes the text in first line to start after some point (we can use px to mention it)
                But the next line onwards it will start from the beginning
                <strong>Hence we can control the Horizontal alignment of the First Line</strong>

            In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since. 'Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,' he told me, 'just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had.'
