        <p>I get up at 5:30 a.m.; after the ablutions I get ready around 6:30 a.m. I have to reach my school by 7:40, so I drive to the school and meet my first deadline. The school activities go on until 1:40; and I remain busy doing them. At 2:05 I drive back home and reach there at 2:30 p.m. I take my lunch at 2:45 p.m. and enjoy a power nap. I get up at 3:30 p.m. and begin my studies, which go on till 5:30 p.m. After that I go for a walk to do some exercise. I watch TV from 7:30 p.m to 9 p.m.; during this time i take my supper and exactly at 9:30 p.m. I study once more till 10:30 p.m. after which I go to bed.</p>
